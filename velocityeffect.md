*How to Make Good Ideas Great and Great Ideas Scale*

## Introduction

This book is about how to **scale**.  An idea, product, or policy can work in the small but can fail (and often does) when trying to scale the idea.  

When something collapses at scale, the book calls it a *voltage drop* (when an enterprise falls at scale and positive results fizzle)

Scaling is about making a large and dramatic change.

*Voltage gain* - holds up to scale but also the impact multiplies

It's not good enough to work with data that already exists.  The **data must be generated**.  Understand the *voltage gains* and *voltage drops* and **why they occur**

**Five Vital Signs**
1. false positives - cases where there was never any voltage in the first place, though it appears otherwise
2. overestimating how big a slice of the pie your idea can capture
3. failing to evaluate whether your initial success depends on unscalable ingredients
4. implementation of your idea has unintended consequences (spillovers) that backfire against that same idea
5. supply-side economics - is it too costly?

I like the terminology *in vitro* vs *in vivo* that conveys something theoretical vs in practice

### 1. Dupers and False Positives

Ideas can be very catchy and we can fool ourselves into thinking that everyone will find it catchy.  Small-scale success, if not evaluated properly, can become hype based on invalid data which leads to a false premise of scaling a project.

**Example**: D.A.R.E although a catchy title, did not actually work.  The program seemed to have some benefit (decrease in drug-usage) in Hawaii, however the data likely fell within *statistical error* yielding a false-positive.  

> The scientific method is the "least worst" method we have for testing and refining important ideas.  

#### Confirmation Bias, the Bandwagon Effect, and the Winner's Curse

**Cognitive bias** - a weakness in human judgment that steer us away from rational decision making

Misinformation can be corrected with good information, but cognitive biases are "hardwired" in the brain which make it much more difficult to correct.

> Confirmation bias prevents us from seeing possibilities that might challenge our assumptions, and it leads us to gather, interpret, and recall information in a way that conforms to our previously held beliefs

Fast-thinking like mental shortcuts or heuristics prevent us from doing the deep analysis necessary to challenge our hypotheses.

**Bandwagon effect** - a.k.a. *herding* or *cascades* or *social contagion* is a social influence on our mental processes.  This comes from the desire to fit in and ego driven.

**Winner's curse** - the desire to "win" may cost you more than what the prize is worth.  This is ego driven.

#### The Revolution of Replication

Replication - the idea that the act of repeating a test would increase the reliability of its results

It's not enough to replicate it yourself, you need to seek an *independent replication* of your result (*a person or team with no vested interest in your success*)

#### The Duper Effect

**Duper** - a person who deliberately lies or mirepresents information to produce a false positive or to get what they want

Dupers exist because of they are responding and reacting to the *incentive structures*.  They are downstream from the incentive structure

Examples
1. Brian Wansink and the food industry
2. Elizabeth Homes and Theranos


The most hazardous obstacle to successful scaling is not ignorance, but the **illusion of knowledge** which can arise from
- misleading data
- hidden biases
- outright deception

You need a **challenge function** to counter the cognitive biases.
