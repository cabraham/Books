# [The Voltage Effect](https://www.amazon.com/Voltage-Effect-Ideas-Great-Scale/dp/0593239482/)
*How to Make Good Ideas Great and Great Ideas Scale*

## Introduction

This book is about how to **scale**.  An idea, product, or policy can work in the small but can fail (and often does) when trying to scale the idea.  

When something collapses at scale, the book calls it a *voltage drop* (when an enterprise falls at scale and positive results fizzle)

Scaling is about making a large and dramatic change.

*Voltage gain* - holds up to scale but also the impact multiplies

It's not good enough to work with data that already exists.  The **data must be generated**.  Understand the *voltage gains* and *voltage drops* and **why they occur**

**Five Vital Signs**
1. false positives - cases where there was never any voltage in the first place, though it appears otherwise
2. overestimating how big a slice of the pie your idea can capture
3. failing to evaluate whether your initial success depends on unscalable ingredients
4. implementation of your idea has unintended consequences (spillovers) that backfire against that same idea
5. supply-side economics - is it too costly?

I like the terminology *in vitro* vs *in vivo* that conveys something theoretical vs in practice

### 1. Dupers and False Positives

Ideas can be very catchy and we can fool ourselves into thinking that everyone will find it catchy.  Small-scale success, if not evaluated properly, can become hype based on invalid data which leads to a false premise of scaling a project.

**Example**: D.A.R.E although a catchy title, did not actually work.  The program seemed to have some benefit (decrease in drug-usage) in Hawaii, however the data likely fell within *statistical error* yielding a false-positive.  

> The scientific method is the "least worst" method we have for testing and refining important ideas.  

#### Confirmation Bias, the Bandwagon Effect, and the Winner's Curse

**Cognitive bias** - a weakness in human judgment that steer us away from rational decision making

Misinformation can be corrected with good information, but cognitive biases are "hardwired" in the brain which make it much more difficult to correct.

> Confirmation bias prevents us from seeing possibilities that might challenge our assumptions, and it leads us to gather, interpret, and recall information in a way that conforms to our previously held beliefs

Fast-thinking like mental shortcuts or heuristics prevent us from doing the deep analysis necessary to challenge our hypotheses.

**Bandwagon effect** - a.k.a. *herding* or *cascades* or *social contagion* is a social influence on our mental processes.  This comes from the desire to fit in and ego driven.

**Winner's curse** - the desire to "win" may cost you more than what the prize is worth.  This is ego driven.

#### The Revolution of Replication

Replication - the idea that the act of repeating a test would increase the reliability of its results

It's not enough to replicate it yourself, you need to seek an *independent replication* of your result (*a person or team with no vested interest in your success*)

#### The Duper Effect

**Duper** - a person who deliberately lies or mirepresents information to produce a false positive or to get what they want

Dupers exist because of they are responding and reacting to the *incentive structures*.  They are downstream from the incentive structure

Examples
1. Brian Wansink and the food industry
2. Elizabeth Homes and Theranos


The most hazardous obstacle to successful scaling is not ignorance, but the **illusion of knowledge** which can arise from
- misleading data
- hidden biases
- outright deception

You need a **challenge function** to counter the cognitive biases.


### 2. Know Your Audience

Example of Lyft experimenting with a membership program.  

The main problem here is that a subscription model only works if it gave access to goods or services unavailable in other platforms.  Uber is another platform providing essentially the same service and easily accessible.

Costco and Netflix do not suffer the same problems here.  For Costco, you can get certain products that you don't get elsewhere, but that doesn't prevent someone from shopping elsewhere for other things.

With Netflix, people don't impulsively switch to another streaming platform.  They often stick with Netflix for their exclusive content.

With Lyft, there wasn't enough differentiation to get loyalty from their customers.

##### The Disneyland Dilemma

Two-part tariff - a business requiring customers pay an entree fee to gain access to products that they then pay for (Costco model)

Two types of customers
1. JoGoods - better deals incentivize them to purchase *even more* goods
2. NoGoods - buy membership because it's a good deal, but it doesn't move them to increase their purchases

The big failure with the Lyft membership program is that those who signed up were already using the service extensively.  The people benefiting from the membership perks were not riding more (not an increase in revenue, but a decrease considering the discounts).

The goal was not to be concerned with how many people joined; but who joined.  

Lyft Pink was born after adding targeted features that they could only get with membership, like waived cancellation fees, priority airport pickups, and exclusive savings deals.

##### Know Your Audience

The question to ask is "How broadly will the idea work?"

You have to consider many factors such as cultures, climates, geographies, socioeconomic groups, etc.  Ideas may work with one demographic but fail in others.  To truly scale, you need universal appeal.

Example of Kmart's Bluelight special.  Initially this was a special program where the store managers had the power to pick the items on sale, knowing their own customer population and distinct needs.  This program was a great success until it failed when Kart decided to manage this centrally and have the *same* items on sale across the board.

##### From Selection Biases to WEIRD People

You need to understand not only your current customers or audience, but your future one.  In other words, the initial test audience may not be a representative snapshot of the larger group.  This is known as *representativeness of population*.

Selection bias - when non-representative selection happens accidentally
Example of the McDonald's and the ArchDeluxe

WEIRD - western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic

##### Broadening Your Audience

What to do if we discover that the current model will not scale past a certain point, yet you still want to expand.

Example of GoPuff.  Started as a company that served college students.  They were wildly successful but wanted to break into new markets.  Adults had different spending habits and product needs.

### 3 - Is It the Chef or the Ingredients?

Example of Jamie Oliver's restaurant

The chef's special touch is a something that can't be scaled, in other words, *talent can't be scaled*.

Jamie Oliver's restaurant scaled well initially, mainly because Jamie's strategy was to keep the necessary skills and ingredients simple.  It was an everyman approach.

What caused the scaling to fail was not food or ingredients, but other less visible ingredients so essential to his empire.  His managing director was especially skilled at hiring the right talent, knowing when and where to expand, and keeping employee morale high.  Jamie also was unable to be present because he overstretched himself.  In other words, there were key people and they were spread too thin.  **Humans don't scale**


##### Negotiables versus Non-negotiables

a.k.a. 
- must have vs nice to have
- critical path vs non critical path
- foundational vs non-foundational

Identify if your business is successful because of the chef or the ingredients.  

If it is the chef, then there will be scaling limitations.  It can be profitable for sure, but it cannot be large scale.  

**Hedonic pricing** - a model that prices a good or service based on its characteristic, not the good itself.  

In terms of non-negotiables vs negotiables, we can see this in practice everywhere.  Non-negotiables to a car are the parts that get it from A to B.  Negotiables are the nav system, leather seating, etc.


##### Keeping the Faith

To achieve high voltage, you need to maintain fidelity to your scalable, non-negotiable sources of success.

"Use" is a non-negotiable in almost every enterprise at scale.  People need to engage with it.  How do they use it?
Examples are: 
- getting patients to take their medication in a clinical trial
- encouraging parents to be involved in their children's education

Lack of fidelity to the non-negotiables leads to *program drift* (a.k.a. mission drift).  This creates an entirely different program offered at scale which have different needs and metrics to scale effectively.  When these don't align, the enterprise often fails.

Counteracting the program drift requires ddressing the economic and psychological incentives.  How do you make the benefits more immediately apparent?

##### Smart Technologies, Dumb People

Technology, especially digital technology, should be inherently scalable.  There is a human component however that has to be considered.  No matter the technology, if people misuse how it was originally intended, it can have disastrous effects to your scaling enterprise.

Compliance (*use*) should be easy.  It will take more investment up front (time, money, legwork, research) but given Murphy's law, it will be worth it to cover your bases early.

To avoid voltage drops, start by imaginging what success would look like at scale applied to the *entire* population.  To do this, you have to start by identifying your non-negotiables.

Example: 
- if the goal is to roll out a program to 50k teachers, then you can't cherry-pick the best teachers at the start of a pilot study because it wouldn't be representative. This is also called **backward induction**.

### 4 - Spillovers

Another term is **unintended consequences**

Example: 
Ralph Nader's rally against automobiles and safety.  His rally required all vehicles to be outfitted with seatbelts.  The unintended consequence is that people felt safer and ended up driving more recklessly.

The phenomenon is called *risk compensation* - the theory that we make different choices depending on how secure we feel in any given situation

##### Spillovers That Emerge at Scale

> Just because you design something to have one effect doesn't mean it won't yield other effects too

*General equilibrium effects* - shifts in an overall market or system that likely don't manifest on a small scale

Example: 
Uber increasing pay for a small subset of Uber drivers by increasing their base fare.  At small scale, this was a great success.  As it scaled up, it attracted more drivers (supply-side went up), which means that the # of rides a driver got went down.

Unintended consequences do not always have to be bad however.
Example: Cash investments to randomized families in rural Kenya not only stimulated the local economy, but also had a positive benefit to families who weren't even given the money (local employment opportunities).

##### The Social Side of Spillovers

There is incentives, but also disincentives.  

*[Resentful demoralization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resentful_demoralization)* - an issue in controlled experiments where the control group becomes resentful and becomes angry, depressed, or is not compliant with the procedures of the experiment

Example: 
Transparency of your peer's salary can disincentivize you from performing at a high level if you are earning a lower wage than others.  However, knowing the salary of the level above you can incentivize you to work harder.

##### High-Voltage Social Spillovers

*Network effect* - when the use of some product or adoption of a policy amplifies the benefits or costs for all users/adopters.  

Example: 
The CHECC program had a direct impact on the students and parents who participated in the program.  It ALSO had an impact on the parents who were not selected in the program because the parents wanted the same outcomes for their children.  Rather than creating resentment for not being selected, the parents were inspired to instill the same values in their own children.

### 5 - The Cost Trap

Starts with the story of Arivale's personalized health company.  The operational costs mandated a high sticker price which customers simply were not willing to pay.  Despite having hit all other marks on scaling, the cost ultimately drove the company to fail.

##### The Cost Side of Scaling

Adam Smith's *The Wealth of Nations* outlines the idea of the "invisible hand" - the unseen forces in a free market that keeps supply and demand in a state of shifting but healthy equilibrium.  

Adam Smith identified **economies of scale**

Up-front investments would normally be considered a *fixed cost* that must be recuperated.

The idea of economies of scale is that prices for a product or service can go down over time as the efficiencies are gained.

There is an inverse to economies of scale which would be **diseconomies of scale**.  This happens when a key resource necessary for production is scarce.

> The lesson here is that in order to successfully scale an enterprise, you need to figure out not only how many people like your idea but also what they are willing to pay for it and, importantly, how much it will cost to provide.

Example: Wise Acre Frozen Treats - wildly successful locally but failed

### 6 - Incentives that Scale

Financial incentives are not the only way to encourage a desired behavior.

**Loss Aversion** - a cognitive bias the describes why, for individuals, the pain of losing is psychologically twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining.

Humans hate losses of any kind, to the point that we avoid losses more than we pursue equivalent gains.  

*Loss Aversion* does not deal with only material resources, but also other types such as *social* losses.
- loss of status
- we don't like to be viewed negatively by others

Example: 
Uber was evaluating different strategies for encouraging tipping.  When the social stigma of *not tipping* was removed (tipping process was separated from driver dropoff and only after the driver reviewed the passenger), passengers did not feel the pressure to tip and so tipping drastically reduced.


##### The $100 Million Nudge and the Power of Social Norms

Example: Dominican Republic was unable to collect taxes effectively.  They created a campaign which either punished citizens with jail time for not paying taxes, or publicly shaming those who did not pay their taxes.  Both strategies were effective, but the public-shaming strategy was easier to scale (you didn't have to incur the cost of jailing someone).

> an aversion to the loss of social standing is part of human nature - and incentivizing people to preserve their reputation by adhering to certain norms can clearly have an acute influence on behavior, often in positive ways.  
> the more widespread someone believes the norm to be-or in other words, the more than violating that norm becomes stigmatized - the more incentivized they are to comply with it


##### The Clawback Approach

Giving incentive rewards upfront with the threat of losing the reward tends to be much more powerful than an incentive at the end.  This is building on top off the *loss aversion* principle; give someone a reward up front and they will believe they own it and work hard to NOT lose their reward.
