# [The Voltage Effect](https://www.amazon.com/Voltage-Effect-Ideas-Great-Scale/dp/0593239482/)
*How to Make Good Ideas Great and Great Ideas Scale*

## Introduction

This book is about how to **scale**.  An idea, product, or policy can work in the small but can fail (and often does) when trying to scale the idea.  

When something collapses at scale, the book calls it a *voltage drop* (when an enterprise falls at scale and positive results fizzle)

Scaling is about making a large and dramatic change.

*Voltage gain* - holds up to scale but also the impact multiplies

It's not good enough to work with data that already exists.  The **data must be generated**.  Understand the *voltage gains* and *voltage drops* and **why they occur**

**Five Vital Signs**
1. false positives - cases where there was never any voltage in the first place, though it appears otherwise
2. overestimating how big a slice of the pie your idea can capture
3. failing to evaluate whether your initial success depends on unscalable ingredients
4. implementation of your idea has unintended consequences (spillovers) that backfire against that same idea
5. supply-side economics - is it too costly?

I like the terminology *in vitro* vs *in vivo* that conveys something theoretical vs in practice

### 1. Dupers and False Positives

Ideas can be very catchy and we can fool ourselves into thinking that everyone will find it catchy.  Small-scale success, if not evaluated properly, can become hype based on invalid data which leads to a false premise of scaling a project.

**Example**: D.A.R.E although a catchy title, did not actually work.  The program seemed to have some benefit (decrease in drug-usage) in Hawaii, however the data likely fell within *statistical error* yielding a false-positive.  

> The scientific method is the "least worst" method we have for testing and refining important ideas.  

#### Confirmation Bias, the Bandwagon Effect, and the Winner's Curse

**Cognitive bias** - a weakness in human judgment that steer us away from rational decision making

Misinformation can be corrected with good information, but cognitive biases are "hardwired" in the brain which make it much more difficult to correct.

> Confirmation bias prevents us from seeing possibilities that might challenge our assumptions, and it leads us to gather, interpret, and recall information in a way that conforms to our previously held beliefs

Fast-thinking like mental shortcuts or heuristics prevent us from doing the deep analysis necessary to challenge our hypotheses.

**Bandwagon effect** - a.k.a. *herding* or *cascades* or *social contagion* is a social influence on our mental processes.  This comes from the desire to fit in and ego driven.

**Winner's curse** - the desire to "win" may cost you more than what the prize is worth.  This is ego driven.

#### The Revolution of Replication

Replication - the idea that the act of repeating a test would increase the reliability of its results

It's not enough to replicate it yourself, you need to seek an *independent replication* of your result (*a person or team with no vested interest in your success*)

#### The Duper Effect

**Duper** - a person who deliberately lies or mirepresents information to produce a false positive or to get what they want

Dupers exist because of they are responding and reacting to the *incentive structures*.  They are downstream from the incentive structure

Examples
1. Brian Wansink and the food industry
2. Elizabeth Homes and Theranos


The most hazardous obstacle to successful scaling is not ignorance, but the **illusion of knowledge** which can arise from
- misleading data
- hidden biases
- outright deception

---

You need a **challenge function** to counter the cognitive biases.


### 2. Know Your Audience

Example of Lyft experimenting with a membership program.  

The main problem here is that a subscription model only works if it gave access to goods or services unavailable in other platforms.  Uber is another platform providing essentially the same service and easily accessible.

Costco and Netflix do not suffer the same problems here.  For Costco, you can get certain products that you don't get elsewhere, but that doesn't prevent someone from shopping elsewhere for other things.

With Netflix, people don't impulsively switch to another streaming platform.  They often stick with Netflix for their exclusive content.

With Lyft, there wasn't enough differentiation to get loyalty from their customers.

##### The Disneyland Dilemma

Two-part tariff - a business requiring customers pay an entree fee to gain access to products that they then pay for (Costco model)

Two types of customers
1. JoGoods - better deals incentivize them to purchase *even more* goods
2. NoGoods - buy membership because it's a good deal, but it doesn't move them to increase their purchases

The big failure with the Lyft membership program is that those who signed up were already using the service extensively.  The people benefiting from the membership perks were not riding more (not an increase in revenue, but a decrease considering the discounts).

The goal was not to be concerned with how many people joined; but who joined.  

Lyft Pink was born after adding targeted features that they could only get with membership, like waived cancellation fees, priority airport pickups, and exclusive savings deals.

##### Know Your Audience

The question to ask is "How broadly will the idea work?"

You have to consider many factors such as cultures, climates, geographies, socioeconomic groups, etc.  Ideas may work with one demographic but fail in others.  To truly scale, you need universal appeal.

Example of Kmart's Bluelight special.  Initially this was a special program where the store managers had the power to pick the items on sale, knowing their own customer population and distinct needs.  This program was a great success until it failed when Kart decided to manage this centrally and have the *same* items on sale across the board.

##### From Selection Biases to WEIRD People

You need to understand not only your current customers or audience, but your future one.  In other words, the initial test audience may not be a representative snapshot of the larger group.  This is known as *representativeness of population*.

Selection bias - when non-representative selection happens accidentally
Example of the McDonald's and the ArchDeluxe

WEIRD - western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic

##### Broadening Your Audience

What to do if we discover that the current model will not scale past a certain point, yet you still want to expand.

Example of GoPuff.  Started as a company that served college students.  They were wildly successful but wanted to break into new markets.  Adults had different spending habits and product needs.
