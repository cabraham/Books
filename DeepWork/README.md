## Introduction
> **The Deep Work Hypothesis:** The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy.  As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.

# Part 1 - The Idea

## Chapter 1 - Deep Work is Valuable
> "Our technologies are racing ahead but many of our skills and organizations are lagging behind."

3 groups have been identified that will be successful in the *The Intelligent Machine Age* 

####  1. High-skilled workers
- Low-skilled positions are being automated away but creates opportunities for high-skilled positions
> "The key question will be: are you good at working with intelligent machines or not?"

#### 2. The Superstars
 - technology has enabled new forms of work (remote).  
 > It no longer makes sense, for example, to hire a full-time programmer, put aside office space, and pay benefits, when you can instead pay one of the world's best programmers, like Hansson, for just enough time to complete the project at hand
 - talent is not a commodity you can buy in bulk
 > Hearing a succession of mediocre singers does not add up to a single outstanding performance

#### 3. The Owners
 - those with the capital to invest in the new technologies
 - this book covers how to gain access to the first 2 groups

**Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy**
1. The ability to quickly master hard things.
2. The ability to product at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.

**Deep Work Helps You Quickly Learn Hard Things**
> To learn requires intense concentration (Sertillanges)
- Research shows that *deliberate practice* is how to master cognitively demanding tasks
- Deliberate practice requires
  1. > your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you're trying to improve or an idea you're trying to master
  2. > you receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it's most productive

- deliberate practice cannot exist alongside distraction
- *diffused attention* is the antithesis of *focused attention*
- there is a neurological foundation for why deliberate practice works (myelin)

High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)

#### Attention residue
- when moving from one task to another, a portion of your attention (residue) remains on the previous task
- this is one reason why multi-tasking is a myth
- communication tools such as e-mail, messaging, social media lower our ability to work deeply
  - even seeing an alert or a flashing window pulls our attention away and potentially causes anxiety to respond to the message/email

> To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction



## Chapter 2 - Deep Work is Rare
---
- There is a paradox.  If deep work is more valuable than ever before in our shifting economy, then why are other ideas prevailing?
    - Serendipitous collaboration
    - rapid communication
        - Instant messaging is meant to be always active
    - active presence on social media
    - open offices

> "interruption, even if short, delays the total time required to complete a task by a significant fraction"

- An experiment in the Harvard Business Review quantified that Atlantic Media was spending over a million dollars a year to pay people to process e-mails

- It's difficult to measure the cost of distraction and the value of depth

- The culture of connectivity hurts employees' well-being and productivity

**Principle of Least Resistance** - without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment

- cultures of connectivity persist because it's *easier*
    1. getting answers to a specific piece of information immediately makes your life easier
        - if this wasn't available, you'd have to do more advanced planning, be organized, and be prepared
    2. you can run your day out of your inbox

- regularly occurring meetings for projects are *easier*
    - what is this accomplishing?  are we managing our time and obligations ourselves or letting the impending meeting each week force us to take action on a given project
    - is it giving a *simulacrum* of progress?

- Richard Feynman, nobel prize winning physicist, avoided any sort of administrative duties such as committees.  He would tell them he's irresponsible to avoid the distractions

**Busyness as Proxy for Productivity** - in the absence of clear indicators of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner

> Knowledge work is not an assembly line

- We no longer discuss the trade-offs surrounding new technologies, balancing, the new efficiencies against the new problems introduced


## Chapter 3 - Deep Work is Meaningful

- Knowledge work can be hard to define and can be ambiguous
    - it may seem that *all* knowledge work boils down to the same output (emails, PPT, charts)
    - there are also many voices convincing knowledge workers to spend time in shallow activities

- Knowledge work can generate satisfaction (connect depth and meaning).  3 arguments to show this
    1. Neurological
    2. Psychological
    3. Philosophical

### Neurological argument for depth
- connection between attention and happiness
>  we tend to place alot of emphasis on our circumstances, assuming what happens to us (or fails to happen) determines how we feel
- our brains construct our worldview based on *what we pay attention to*
- deep endeavors require focus and prevvents you from noticing the many smaller and less pleasant things that persistently populate our lives
> a workday driven by the shallow, from a neurological perspective, is likely to be a draining and upsetting day, even if most of the shallow things that capture your attention seem harmless or fun

### Psychological argument for depth
> The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile
 - Csikszentmihalyi calls this *flow*
 - Conventional thought is that relaxation makes people happy but
> Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one's work, to concentrate and lose onself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed

- Gallagher's theory emphasizes the content, giving focused attention to something forced you to ignore shallow negative things
- Csikszentmihalyi is mostly agnostic to the content

- build your working life around the experience of flow produced by deep work

### Philosophical argument for depth
- Notions of sacredness and meaning have evolved throughout history
- From Descartes's skepticism came the radical belief that individual seeking certainty trumped a God or king bestowing truth (basis of Enlightenment)
- In Post-Enlightenment, we ourselves identify what's meaningful and not... which seems arbitrary and ultimately nihilistic
- Craftsmanship provides a key to reopening a sense of sacredness in a responsible manner
> The task of a craftsman, they conclude, "is not to *generate* meaning, but rather to *cultivate* in himself the skill of *discerning* the meanings that are *already there*."


# Part 2 - The Rules

## Rule 1 - Work Deeply

> You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it
- You must move beyond good intentions and implement *routines* and *rituals* designed to minimize distractions

### 6 strategies
#### Decide on your depth philosophy
 - Monastic philosophy - eliminate or radically minimize shallow obligations
 - Bimodal philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling - divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else
    - a minimum amount of time is required to reach maximum cognitive intensity.  The period tends to be at least one full day
 - Rhythmic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling - having a simple regular habit
    - Seinfeld's chain method is an example where he placed big red Xs on the calendar when he's done work
    - the segments of time dedicated should be on a regular schedule.  Adhoc scheduling isn't compatible with this philosophy
    - for most people, the demands of regular life make monastic and bimodal philosophies incompatible, rather rhythmic philosophy works quite well
- Journalistic Philosophy of Deep Work Scheduling - fitting in deep work wherever you can into your schedule
    - usually deadline driven (like journalists)
    - not for a deep work novice
    - switching into Deep Work mode doesn't come naturally and depletes your willpower reserves rapidly

#### Ritualize
 - build rituals of the same level of strictness and idiosyncrasy 
 > *Great creative minds think like artists but work like accountants."* - David Brooks from NYT

 Any effective ritual must address the following: 
 - **where you'll work and for how long** (specify a location and give a specific time frame)
 - **How you'll work once you start to work** - rules and processes to keep your efforts structured
   - examples are to eliminate internet usage or maintain a metric of words produced per twenty-minute interval
 - **How you'll support your work** - ensure your brain gets the support it needs to keep operating at a high level of depth
   - examples are getting a good cup of coffee or organizing raw materials of your work to minimize energy-dissipating friction
   - don't try to figure out what you need in the moment.  Systematize this

#### Make Grand Gestures
> By leveraging a a radical change to your normal environment, coupled perhaps iwth a significant investment of effort or money, all dedicated toward supporting a deep work task, you increase the perceived importance of the task
- An example of this are J.K. Rowling writing the Deathly Hallows.  She checked herself into a luxurious hotel that cost $1,000 per day.  
- Another example is Bill Gates taking Think Weeks and retreat to a cabin (giving up his work and family obligations for that period)
> Sometimes to go depe, you must first go big

#### Don't Work Alone
 - The *theory of serendipitous creativity* 
    - Open office layouts at tech giant companies like Facebook theorized that collaborations between individuals would drive creative thinking, which seems opposite of Deep Work philosophy
 - MIT's Building 20 - created as a temporary shelter during World War II.  Eventually was used as over-flow space for the influx of engineers and sicentists. 
 - Bell Labs intentionally created an environment that promoted these serendipitous encounters... however it was a *hub and spoke* model
    - the hub is the common areas where these interactions can take place
    - the spoke is the areas for focus and intense concentrations
 - The balance of both hub and spoke is what launched Bell Labs' success.

#### Execute Like a Business
The 4 Disciplines of Execution (4DX)

##### Discipline 1: Focus on the Wildly Important
 - Wildly Important Goals (WIGs)
 > *"If you want to win the war for attention, don't try to say 'no' to the trivial distractions you find on the information smorgasbord; try to say 'yes' to the subject htat arouses a terrifying longing, and let the terrifying longing crowd out everything else."* - The Art of Focus by David Brooks
 [Hell Yeah or No](https://www.amazon.com/Hell-Yeah-No-whats-worth/dp/1988575117) - by Derek Sivers
 
##### Discipline 2: Act on the Lead Measures
2 types of measures.  
*Lag* measure - describe the thing you're ultimately trying to improve
 - the problem is lag measures come too late to change your behavior

*Lead* measure - measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures
 - turn your attention to improving the behaviors you directly control in the near future that will affect the long-term goals

Lead measures provide feedback quicker (like Agile vs Waterfall)

##### Discipline 3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard
A public place to record and track lead measures.  A scoreboard is a great example
- It provides a reinforcing source of motivation
> Once the team notices their success with a lead measure, they become invested in perpetuating this performance


##### Discipline 4: Create a Cadence of Accountability
> Put in place "a rhythm of regular and frequent meetings of any team that owns a wildly important goal"
- team members must confront their scoreboard, commit to specific actions to help improve the score before the next meeting
This works even in deep work for a single person.  
You can decide to have a weekly review to measure good or bad weeks and identify causes for bad weeks.  This helps to ensure future good weeks.
The rhythm and cadence of the deep work tends to outweigh the intensity of the deep work


#### Be Lazy
Allow your brain to reset and disconnect from the deep work.  
A *shutdown* process helps it helps with deep work

##### Reason 1: Downtime Aids Insights
Different types of brain activity can be associated to different workloads
- Conscious mind - best suited for decisions that require the application of strict rules
- Unconscious mind - best suited for decisions that involve large amounts of information, vague and maybe conflicting constraints
> The implication of this line of research is that providing your conscious brain time to rest enables your unconscious mind to take a shift sorting through your most complex professional challenges

##### Reason 2: Downtime Helps Recharge the Energy Needed to Work Deeply
Attention restoration theory (ART) - spending time in nature can improve your ability to concentrate
*Concentration* according to ART, is *directed attention*.  This is a finite resource

Examples: 
 - taking a walk in nature
 - playing a game with your children
 - cooking dinner

The important piece here is that you are completely disconnected from the Deep Work.  Checking emails or responding to messages after shutdown prevents the recovery of concentration

##### Reason 3: The Work That Evening Downtime Replaces Is Usually Not That Important
Your brain's capacity for deep work is limited to a few hours. Therefore work performed after the shutdown, you're beyond the point where you can continue to effectively work deeply.  
- this means that work after shutdown is not high-value activity

**Shutdown ritual** - should ensure that every incomplete task, goal, or project has been reviewed and that for each you have confirmed that either
1. you have a plan you trust for its completion
2. it's captured in a place where it will be revisited when the time is right

Zeigarnik effect - the ability of incomplete tasks to dominate our attention
- you can counteract this effect by having a plan for how it will be accomplished later

Capture every task in a common list, and then review these tasks before making a plan for the next day

Shutdown rituals can become annoying, because they add an extra 10 to 15 minutes at the end of your workday, but they're necessary for reaping the rewards of systematic idleness


## Rule 2 - Embrace Boredom

The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained like a *mental muscle*

> Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don't simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction

People who multitask all the time can't filter out irrelevancy, manage a working memory, and are chronically distracted.  They initiate much larger parts of their brain that are irrelevant to the task at hand

Filling all moments of free time to look at our smartphones has rewired our brains to prevent us from doing deep work.

##### Don't Take Breaks from Distraction.  Instead Take Breaks from Focus.

> If you eat healthy just one day a week, you're unlikely to lose weight, as the majorify of your time is still spent gorging.

Temporary *Internet Sabbaths* does not cure the problem of our rewired brains.  There are benefits but it doesn't cure the problem.

Schedule in advance when you'll allow distractions (e.g. YouTube, Social Media, etc).  

**Point #1**: *This strategy works even if your job requires lots of Internet use and/or prompt e-mail replies*
- Schedule to your needs

**Point #2**: *Regardless of how you schedule your Internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet use*
- resist temptation if you end up with free time.  One distraction can lead to the next

**Point #3**: *Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration training*
- effort put in work can be undone by afterwork distractions.  continue this practice at home
- the goal here isn't to avoid or even reduce the total amount of time spent engaging in distracting behavior, but to resist switching to these distracting behaviors when bored

##### Work like Teddy Roosevelt
- He was known to have many interests like boxing, wrestling, body building, dance, etc.  Despite all of these interests, he still was able to entertain these AND do well in school
- The key to this was that he was intensely focused on those blocks of time

A strategy here is to select something that's high on the priority list, estimate how long you'd normally put aside for the obligation, and then set a hard deadline that drastically reduces this time.  This forces working with great intensity

> Deep work requires levels of concentration well beyond where most knowledge workers are comfortable.  *Roosevelt dashes* leverage artificial deadlines to help you systematically increase the level you can regularly achieve - providing, in some sense, **interval training** for the attention centers of your brain

##### Meditate productively

> The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you're occupied physically but not mentally - and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem

This works by forcing you to resist distraction and return your attention repeatedly to a well-defined problem

2 suggestions to improve ramp-up of this practice

**#1:** *Be Wary of Distractions and Looping* 

When first starting productive meditation, your mind may rebel and try to other things to fixate on (distraction) or your mind may avoid diving deeper into the problem by *looping* over what you already know.  

**#2:** *Structure Your Deep Thinking*

Steps for structuring your thinking

1. Make note of relevant variables for solving the problem and keep those in your working memory
2. After identifying the variables, define the specific *next-step question* you need to answer using these variables
3. Consolidate your gains by reviewing clearly the answer you identified
4. Start the process over

##### Memorize a Deck of Cards

> "We found that one of the biggest differences between memory athletes and the rest of us is in a cognitive ability that's not a direct measure of memory at all *but of attention*" - Roediger

This is known as "attentional control"

Memory athletes do not use rote memorization to practice their retention.  

Our brains are great at memorizing many details associated with visual images and associations

> Your ability to concentrate is only as strong as your commitment to train it

## Rule #3 - Quit Social Media

*Network tools* like Facebook, Twitter, etc fragment our time and reduce our ability to concentrate.  
These tools steal your attention and willpower in bite-sized chunks with distraction and useless information.
It may not be possible to quit social media altogether, but there is an optional middle-ground.

Understand why you're using these tools.  They may provide some level of entertainment or friendship, but what these tools provide are light weight.  Are we using these tools because we lack entertainment options or deep connection?  Do these tools really provide the answer?

Remember that social media tools are designed by for-profit companies to be addictive and grab your attention all the itme. 

The "Any-Benefit" mindset - using a network tool if you can identify *any* possible benefit to its use

Network tools are tools like any other tool.  You have to put thought into the tools you use.  Tools provide benefits, but also costs.  Sometimes the tool may be at odds with your main baseline goals.

> **The Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection** - Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life.  Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweight the negative impacts.

##### Apply the Law of the Vital Few to Your Internet Habits

Step 1 - Identify the main high-level goals for your professional and personal life.
Step 2 - List for each of these goals, two or three most important activities that help satisfy the goal
Step 3 - Evaluate each tool against the key activities and ask whether they have a *substantial positive impact* or a *substantial negative impact*


> **The Law of the Vital Few**: In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes.

This is basically the 80/20 rule - the power law distribution over impact

Highlight the idea that all activities take up your time and energy (both limited resources)... both low-impact and high-impact activities.  It's a **zero-sum game**.  Therefore we need to be wise where we put this.  

Business do this already because they choose to *fire* their customers of lower value to invest in the needs of their higher impact customers

##### Quit Social Media

One strategy to quit is to put a temporary ban on all of it for a period of time (e.g. 30 days).  After the time period is up, ask yourself: 
1. Would the last thirty days have been notably better if I had been able to use this service?
2. Did people care that I wasn't using this service?

If the answer is no, then you can quit entirely.

This is similar to putting all your *stuff* in boxes and packing them away.  Do you ever touch them?  No?  Then you don't need it.

Using social media gives us a false sense of importance.  Do people really care about what we say?  


##### Don't Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself

> The "great and profound mistake which my typical man makes in regard to his day," he elaborates, is that even though he doesn't particularly enjoy his work (seeing it as something to "get through"), "he persists in looking upon those hours from ten to six as 'the day,' to which the ten hours preceding them and the six hours following them are nothing but a prologue and epilogue." - Arnold Bennett

You *should* and *can* make deliberate use of your time outside work

Media, especially online media, does their best to get your attention.  It's a science and they know the psychology.  *Trending* and *popular* titles and images are targeted to keep us engaged.  Most of this stuff is utter garbage.

> Put thought into your leisure time

> *What? You say that full energy given to those sixteen hours will lessen the value of the business eight? Not so. On the contrary, it will assuredly increase the value of the business eight. One of the chief things which my typical man has to learn is that the mental faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity; they do not tire like an arm or a leg. All they want is change - not rest, except in sleep* - Bennett


## Rule #4 - Drain the Shallows

Example of 37signals reducing from 5 days to 4 day workweek.  They did this by *cutting the fat* (reducing shallow work).  Reducing the amount of time makes your respect the time more. Become stingy with your time.

The 37signals made an experiment where they temporarily removed all shallow work and allowed their staff to focus deeply on their own creative projects for 1 month.  This is in contrast to Google simply giving 20% of their time.  The results of the experiment were very positive and the company was able to put into production 2 of the proposed projects.

There is a cognitive limit to deep work.  Beginners are about 1 hour and experts tap out around 4.  After this amount of time, you'll experience diminishing returns.

> treat shallow work with suspicion because its damage is often vastly understimated and its importance vastly overestimated

##### Schedule Every Minute of Your Day

It's very easy to lose track of your time and have the impression that you spend less time in shallow activity than in reality.

Ask yourself *"What makes the most sense right now?"* before taking any action.

Strategy
 - create time blocks for your whole work day
 - assign activities to each of those blocks
 - shallow work tasks can be batched to one of those blocks

If things go wrong (interruptions or time-estimates are off), revise the schedule

Tactics to account for when things go wrong
 - recognize that almost definitely you're going to underestimate how much time you need
 - create overflow conditional blocks (blocks that have a split purpose)
    - if the task overruns, use the overflow block to keep working on it
    - if the task is completed however, have another activity associated

The goal of a schedule is about thoughtfulness for your day... not about constraints and rigidity to your day.  It allows for spontaneity if you consciously allow it to.

> **Treat your time with respect**

##### Quantify the Depth of Every Activity

> **Shallow Work**: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend not to create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.


Ask yourself:
> "How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?

This question is a thought experiment that helps quantify the depth of your work.  

##### Ask Your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget

Creating a budget for shallow work can impose limits on how much shallow work you will accept.  

The idea is not to abandon core shallow obligations, but recognize a hard limit on shallow work so that it doesn't overtake the deep work.

Having a conversation with your boss establishes an agreement from the workplace, so that you have cover when you turn down shallow work.

The conversation can be data-driven.  "This is how much time I spent this week on shallow work".  

One strategy is a fixed-schedule productivity.  Setting aggressive or drastic quotas for the amount of work you will get done will make you consider more carefully when to say "yes" to a shallow task.

##### Become Hard to Reach

> "we are slowly eroding our ability to explain - in a careful, complex way- why it is so wrong for us to compalin, resist, or redesign our workdays so that they are manageable." - *The Tyranny of E-mail*

**Tip #1**: Make People Who Send You E-mail Do More Work
*sender filter* - ask your correspondents to filter themselves before attempting to contact you
The author gives an example by stating reasons why you would email to a specific address (e.g. interesting@calnewport.com)

Reset your correspondents expectations.  This means stating that
1. you may only respond to those things you find interesting
2. you may only respond between certain hours
3. telling them to review a FAQ to verify the question hasn't already been asked

**Tip #2**: Do More Work When You Send or Reply to E-mails

Vague interrogative emails invoke an initial instinct to respond with the quickest possible response.  
The problem is that these quick responses only compound future shallow work because it will bounce back.  

Ask yourself
> *What is the project represented by this message, and what is the most efficient (in terms of messages generated) process for bringing this project to a successful conclusion?*

Answer the question for yourself, and the response should describe the process you identified, points out the next current step, and emphasize the step that comes next.  This is called the *process-centric approach*

The goal is to reduce the number of roundtrips (messages) needed to complete the thread.  

**Tip #3**: Don't Respond

The sender has to convince the receiver that a reply is worthwhile.

Replies are assumed, regardless of the relevance or appropriateness of the message.  

Some people may get confused or upset about the lack of response.  This is okay.
