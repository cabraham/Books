## Chapter 1 - What if?

We should *worry* about risks, but we must also *act*.  

We can't focus simply on the probability of something happening, but on what we can do about it.

## Risk Immune System
- **Detect** threats
- **Assess** the risk they represent, based on our own vulnerabilities
- **Respond** to avoid or mitigate any negative effects of the risk.
- **Learn** so that we are well prepared if the risk reappears

The author makes comparisons to the immune system of the body.  
> The miracle of hte immune system lies in its ability to rapidly and accurately identify friend (good cell), from foe (potentially harmful pathogen), mount an effective response to defend the body, and then remember what it learned

> Time and again we see that ***the greatest risk to us as individuals, and to our organizations, is us***.


## Simple mathematical formula for risk

### Threat x Vulnerability = Risk

Threat and Vulnerability are never 0, therefore there is always a risk.

## Ten dimensions of control present in every organization
1. Communication: How we exchange information with others
2. Narrative: How we tell others about who we are and what we do
3. Structure: How we design our organizations and processes
4. Technology: How we apply machinery, equipment, resources, and know-how
5. Diversity: How we leverage a range of perspectives and abilities
6. Bias: How the assumptions we have about hte world influence us
7. Action: How we overcome inertia or resistance to drive our response
8. Timing: How when we act affects the effectiveness of our response
9. Adaptability: How we respond to changing risks and environments
10. Leadership: How we direct and inspire the overall Risk Immune System

These are all like a series of gears, where the movement of one affects the shifting of all

> The Bottom Line: We can't control the emergence of threats - but we can make our organizations less vulnerable

## Chapter 2 - Damocles and Me

Individuals, especially leaders, operate in an environment of constant risk

We can't live in data and try to account for all risks, no matter how well-informed and diligent we are.  Today's world is constantly moving and is fast paced, which means risks are changing.

We all try to balance the probability of an event or outcome and the consequences if it did happen

> Those who are comfortable with assessing and responding to risks in peacetime are the same under fire.

War story: The Iranian Hostage Crisis
- President Carter asked Major General James Vaught about the probability of success for rescue
- The answer was estimated about 85%
- The problem was that this mission required a series of steps that had to be executed in sequence.  Each step (there were 9 steps) had to be executed in sequence and each step had a 90% success rate
- .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 = .348 (~ 35% chance of success)
- the mission was a failure 

> There is a cost both to becoming overly focused on risk and to ignoring it.

Focusing on external risk factors is less valuable than focusing on your strengths and vulnerabilities.

> The Bottom Line: While risk is often portrayed mathematically, our response to risk is more often instinctive. Understanding the factors that drive how we think about and act upon risk is critical.

# Part 2 - Risk Control Factors

## Chapter 3 - Communication - The lifeblood of the system

The 4 tests to determine is communciation is effective
1. The physical ability to pass the information (can or can't)
2. The willingness to pass it (will or won't)
3. The quality of the message (accurate, complete, timely, relevant)
4. The receipt of the information (able or unable to digest and understand the message)


### Symptoms of Communication Challenges
|Symptom | Description |
|---|---|
|**Failure to Transmit** |A failure to send information guarantees it won't e received.  But how often do we as individuals or organizations fail to share key knowledge?|
|**Failure to Receive** |An inability or unwillingness to receive or "hear" information also negates its value|
|**Lack of a Pathway**|More common in earlier days with less sophisticated technology, the physical inability to share information in a timely fashion often results in uncoordinated efforts|
|**Misunderstood Message(s)**|A lack of clarity from the sender or insufficient knowledge or context in the recipient can render otherwise critical communication ineffective|
|**Overloaded Communications**|An excessive volume of information can cause truly essential "signal" to be lost in the "noise"|
|**Distorted or Corrupted Message(s)**|When key information is unintentionally misstated or misinterpreted, it is rendered potentially dangerous|
|**Intentional Misinformation**|Information is intentionally corrupted to deceive or confuse, as in propoganda and in similar efforts|

War story: September 11th attack
- Findings from the 9/11 Commission Report
    - There had been many messages and signals warning important decision-makers of an impending attack
    - The CIA selected between six and eight articles or briefings for the President's Daily Brief (PDB)
    - Entries related to Usama Bin Laden was mentioned at least 40 times, often of impending attack, but with not enough clarity of what country
    - Only 3% of the PDB entries were devoted to Usama Bin Laden, with just a sliver of that pertaining to the likelihood of domestic attack
    - No one could connect the dots.  The message was incomplete and the reports were not pieced together to create a coherent story
    > the system was blinking red on several separate dashboards, each with hundreds of other flashing lights

> *"What gets us into trouble is not what we don't know. It's what we know for sure that just ain't so."* - Mark Twain

#### War On Truth

It is human nature to seek out a signal, especially simple and one-dimensional slogans could be used to appeal to people's emotions.  

**Examples:**
- Nazi propaganda - restoring the Fatherland to its former greatness
- Tobacco company propaganda - to instill doubt that smoking leads to cancer


#### Join or Die

<img src="images/joinordie.png" alt="join or die" width="400"/>

"Join or Die" is a famous American Revolution slogan reminding the colonies that they must fight together.  A snake cut into pieces will not survive.

> The Bottom Line: Communication allows the Risk Immune System to work. Get this right or we fail.

## Chapter 4 - Narrative - The Mind of the Beholder

War story: The Battle of the Alamo
- although the battle was ultimately lost, the narrative created gives a sense of pride to the *Texicans*


Example: 
- In 1957, VP Richard Nixon attended a ceremony celebrating Ghana's independence
- He approached a black guest and asked "How does it feel to be free"
- The man responded, "I wouldn't know.  I'm from Alabama"
- Although the narrative of the US is about freedom and that all men are created equal, it seemed Ghana was living up to the narrative better than the US


### Symptoms of Narrative Misalignment
|Symptom | Description |
|---|---|
|**Cynicism**|Team members conclude that the organization's narrative does not adequately or accurately describe what they are actually asked to do|
|**The "Say-Do" Gap**|Leaders espouse one thing - and then do another. Lofty values sound good, but employees know when the bottom line and other interests trump ideals. And most resent it.|
|**Muddled Priorities**| When we aren't clear on who we are or what we're trying to do, it's hard to prioritize actions|
|**Tensions**|Misunderstood or conflicting narratives can undermine confidence and committment|
|**Brand Damage**|Untrue or ineffective brand narratives can destroy the credibility of our products and businesses|

Example: 
- Google's slogan was "Don't be evil"
- This made the employees of Google feel like their work mattered and that they were changing the world
- Google then had project Maven (contract with the DoD), and Project DragonFly (contract with Chinese government for censorship)

Example: 
- Uncle Sam "I want you for U.S. Army"
- The Army had a number of campaigns to encourage young men to enlist
- The "What's your warrior" campaign is the latest one.  
    - The author believes that the word *warrior* doesn't capture the whole picture.  Warriors fight.  Soldiers also have to consider the law, ethics, and morality.

> The Bottom Line: When our narrative is misaligned to our purpose, values, or strategy, we invite risk into our organization
