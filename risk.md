## Chapter 1 - What if?

We should *worry* about risks, but we must also *act*.  

We can't focus simply on the probability of something happening, but on what we can do about it.

## Risk Immune System
- **Detect** threats
- **Assess** the risk they represent, based on our own vulnerabilities
- **Respond** to avoid or mitigate any negative effects of the risk.
- **Learn** so that we are well prepared if the risk reappears

The author makes comparisons to the immune system of the body.  
> The miracle of hte immune system lies in its ability to rapidly and accurately identify friend (good cell), from foe (potentially harmful pathogen), mount an effective response to defend the body, and then remember what it learned

> Time and again we see that ***the greatest risk to us as individuals, and to our organizations, is us***.


## Simple mathematical formula for risk

### Threat x Vulnerability = Risk

Threat and Vulnerability are never 0, therefore there is always a risk.

## Ten dimensions of control present in every organization
1. Communication: How we exchange information with others
2. Narrative: How we tell others about who we are and what we do
3. Structure: How we design our organizations and processes
4. Technology: How we apply machinery, equipment, resources, and know-how
5. Diversity: How we leverage a range of perspectives and abilities
6. Bias: How the assumptions we have about hte world influence us
7. Action: How we overcome inertia or resistance to drive our response
8. Timing: How when we act affects the effectiveness of our response
9. Adaptability: How we respond to changing risks and environments
10. Leadership: How we direct and inspire the overall Risk Immune System

These are all like a series of gears, where the movement of one affects the shifting of all

> The Bottom Line: We can't control the emergence of threats - but we can make our organizations less vulnerable

## Chapter 2 - Damocles and Me

Individuals, especially leaders, operate in an environment of constant risk

We can't live in data and try to account for all risks, no matter how well-informed and diligent we are.  Today's world is constantly moving and is fast paced, which means risks are changing.

We all try to balance the probability of an event or outcome and the consequences if it did happen

> Those who are comfortable with assessing and responding to risks in peacetime are the same under fire.

War story: The Iranian Hostage Crisis
- President Carter asked Major General James Vaught about the probability of success for rescue
- The answer was estimated about 85%
- The problem was that this mission required a series of steps that had to be executed in sequence.  Each step (there were 9 steps) had to be executed in sequence and each step had a 90% success rate
- .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 = .348 (~ 35% chance of success)
- the mission was a failure 

> There is a cost both to becoming overly focused on risk and to ignoring it.

Focusing on external risk factors is less valuable than focusing on your strengths and vulnerabilities.

> The Bottom Line: While risk is often portrayed mathematically, our response to risk is more often instinctive. Understanding the factors that drive how we think about and act upon risk is critical.

# Part 2 - Risk Control Factors

## Chapter 3 - Communication - The lifeblood of the system

The 4 tests to determine is communciation is effective
1. The physical ability to pass the information (can or can't)
2. The willingness to pass it (will or won't)
3. The quality of the message (accurate, complete, timely, relevant)
4. The receipt of the information (able or unable to digest and understand the message)
