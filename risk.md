# [Risk - A User's Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Risk-Users-Guide-Stanley-McChrystal/dp/0593192206)

## Chapter 1 - What if?

We should *worry* about risks, but we must also *act*.  

We can't focus simply on the probability of something happening, but on what we can do about it.

## Risk Immune System
- **Detect** threats
- **Assess** the risk they represent, based on our own vulnerabilities
- **Respond** to avoid or mitigate any negative effects of the risk.
- **Learn** so that we are well prepared if the risk reappears

The author makes comparisons to the immune system of the body.  
> The miracle of the immune system lies in its ability to rapidly and accurately identify friend (good cell), from foe (potentially harmful pathogen), mount an effective response to defend the body, and then remember what it learned

> Time and again we see that ***the greatest risk to us as individuals, and to our organizations, is us***.


## Simple mathematical formula for risk

### Threat x Vulnerability = Risk

Threat and Vulnerability are never 0, therefore there is always a risk.

## Ten dimensions of control present in every organization
1. Communication: How we exchange information with others
2. Narrative: How we tell others about who we are and what we do
3. Structure: How we design our organizations and processes
4. Technology: How we apply machinery, equipment, resources, and know-how
5. Diversity: How we leverage a range of perspectives and abilities
6. Bias: How the assumptions we have about hte world influence us
7. Action: How we overcome inertia or resistance to drive our response
8. Timing: How when we act affects the effectiveness of our response
9. Adaptability: How we respond to changing risks and environments
10. Leadership: How we direct and inspire the overall Risk Immune System

These are all like a series of gears, where the movement of one affects the shifting of all

> The Bottom Line: We can't control the emergence of threats - but we can make our organizations less vulnerable

---

## Chapter 2 - Damocles and Me

Individuals, especially leaders, operate in an environment of constant risk

We can't live in data and try to account for all risks, no matter how well-informed and diligent we are.  Today's world is constantly moving and is fast paced, which means risks are changing.

We all try to balance the probability of an event or outcome and the consequences if it did happen

> Those who are comfortable with assessing and responding to risks in peacetime are the same under fire.

War story: The Iranian Hostage Crisis
- President Carter asked Major General James Vaught about the probability of success for rescue
- The answer was estimated about 85%
- The problem was that this mission required a series of steps that had to be executed in sequence.  Each step (there were 9 steps) had to be executed in sequence and each step had a 90% success rate
- .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 = .348 (~ 35% chance of success)
- the mission was a failure 

> There is a cost both to becoming overly focused on risk and to ignoring it.

Focusing on external risk factors is less valuable than focusing on your strengths and vulnerabilities.

> The Bottom Line: While risk is often portrayed mathematically, our response to risk is more often instinctive. Understanding the factors that drive how we think about and act upon risk is critical.

# Part 2 - Risk Control Factors

## Chapter 3 - Communication - The lifeblood of the system

The 4 tests to determine is communciation is effective
1. The physical ability to pass the information (can or can't)
2. The willingness to pass it (will or won't)
3. The quality of the message (accurate, complete, timely, relevant)
4. The receipt of the information (able or unable to digest and understand the message)


### Symptoms of Communication Challenges
|Symptom | Description |
|---|---|
|**Failure to Transmit** |A failure to send information guarantees it won't e received.  But how often do we as individuals or organizations fail to share key knowledge?|
|**Failure to Receive** |An inability or unwillingness to receive or "hear" information also negates its value|
|**Lack of a Pathway**|More common in earlier days with less sophisticated technology, the physical inability to share information in a timely fashion often results in uncoordinated efforts|
|**Misunderstood Message(s)**|A lack of clarity from the sender or insufficient knowledge or context in the recipient can render otherwise critical communication ineffective|
|**Overloaded Communications**|An excessive volume of information can cause truly essential "signal" to be lost in the "noise"|
|**Distorted or Corrupted Message(s)**|When key information is unintentionally misstated or misinterpreted, it is rendered potentially dangerous|
|**Intentional Misinformation**|Information is intentionally corrupted to deceive or confuse, as in propoganda and in similar efforts|

War story: September 11th attack
- Findings from the 9/11 Commission Report
    - There had been many messages and signals warning important decision-makers of an impending attack
    - The CIA selected between six and eight articles or briefings for the President's Daily Brief (PDB)
    - Entries related to Usama Bin Laden was mentioned at least 40 times, often of impending attack, but with not enough clarity of what country
    - Only 3% of the PDB entries were devoted to Usama Bin Laden, with just a sliver of that pertaining to the likelihood of domestic attack
    - No one could connect the dots.  The message was incomplete and the reports were not pieced together to create a coherent story
    > the system was blinking red on several separate dashboards, each with hundreds of other flashing lights

> *"What gets us into trouble is not what we don't know. It's what we know for sure that just ain't so."* - Mark Twain

#### War On Truth

It is human nature to seek out a signal, especially simple and one-dimensional slogans could be used to appeal to people's emotions.  

**Examples:**
- Nazi propaganda - restoring the Fatherland to its former greatness
- Tobacco company propaganda - to instill doubt that smoking leads to cancer


#### Join or Die

<img src="images/joinordie.png" alt="join or die" width="400"/>

"Join or Die" is a famous American Revolution slogan reminding the colonies that they must fight together.  A snake cut into pieces will not survive.

> The Bottom Line: Communication allows the Risk Immune System to work. Get this right or we fail.

## Chapter 4 - Narrative - The Mind of the Beholder

War story: The Battle of the Alamo
- although the battle was ultimately lost, the narrative created gives a sense of pride to the *Texicans*


Example: 
- In 1957, VP Richard Nixon attended a ceremony celebrating Ghana's independence
- He approached a black guest and asked "How does it feel to be free"
- The man responded, "I wouldn't know.  I'm from Alabama"
- Although the narrative of the US is about freedom and that all men are created equal, it seemed Ghana was living up to the narrative better than the US


### Symptoms of Narrative Misalignment
|Symptom | Description |
|---|---|
|**Cynicism**|Team members conclude that the organization's narrative does not adequately or accurately describe what they are actually asked to do|
|**The "Say-Do" Gap**|Leaders espouse one thing - and then do another. Lofty values sound good, but employees know when the bottom line and other interests trump ideals. And most resent it.|
|**Muddled Priorities**| When we aren't clear on who we are or what we're trying to do, it's hard to prioritize actions|
|**Tensions**|Misunderstood or conflicting narratives can undermine confidence and committment|
|**Brand Damage**|Untrue or ineffective brand narratives can destroy the credibility of our products and businesses|

Example: 
- Google's slogan was "Don't be evil"
- This made the employees of Google feel like their work mattered and that they were changing the world
- Google then had project Maven (contract with the DoD), and Project DragonFly (contract with Chinese government for censorship)

Example: 
- Uncle Sam "I want you for U.S. Army"
- The Army had a number of campaigns to encourage young men to enlist
- The "What's your warrior" campaign is the latest one.  
    - The author believes that the word *warrior* doesn't capture the whole picture.  Warriors fight.  Soldiers also have to consider the law, ethics, and morality.

> The Bottom Line: When our narrative is misaligned to our purpose, values, or strategy, we invite risk into our organization

---

## Chapter 5 - Structure

War Story: Korean war
- American and allies forces were struggling to establish a coherent line of defense


We function best as part of a whole, within a structure that operates like a machine

> Our own structures often exacerbate, not alleviate, already tricky national security dangers

### Symptoms of Structure Problems
|Symption|Description|
|---|---|
|**Unclear Roles and Responsibilities**|Individuals and subordinate organizations are unsure of who is supposed to be doing what. And so much gets left undone |
|**Duplicative Efforts**|An ill-defined organization leads to multiple parties attempting to accomplish the same tasks|
|**Gaps Where Seams Should Be Tight**|Everyone thinks someone else was supposed to bring the beer to the party|
|**Tortured Communications**|Information travels painfully slow through the labyrinth - typically too late to address the need|
|**The Longest Chain**|You have to get approval from your boss's boss's boss-and you're not even sure who that is|

Formal reorganization efforts are difficult because they are plagued with bureaucratic hurdles.  Making changes "provisionally" and making things cross-functional however is something that can be iterated on.

> Structure *informs* power
- The structure informs who can work with whom, who exerts influence, and who is subject to power

Often organizations have units that are responsible for managing risk, but these units are often prevented from influencing decision-making.

> **The Bottom Line**: Structure enables or inhibits the effective functionining of any organization's Risk Immune System.  
> Understanding structure's impact on our processes and culture, positive or negative, is critical

## Chapter 6 - Technology - The Turbulent Marriage of Man and Machine

War Story: Soviet Russia and nuclear arms
- Lieutenant Colonel Petrov of the Soviet Union didn't trust the alerts by their computer systems.
- He had a "feeling" in his gut that there was something wrong w/ the alerts
- The signals he was receiving from various systems didn't line up



---

## Chapter 7 - Diversity - Blind men and Elephants

The chapter starts off with the story of the brutal attack by police and deputized whites against those marching for securing voting rights for African Americans.

The civil rights movement was about *equality*, not *diversity*.  

According to the author, demographic diversity is insufficient on its own.
Diversity of thought is more important.
Diversity of capability

### Symptoms of Diversity Challenges
|Symption|Description|
|---|---|
|**Stale Preservation of the Status Quo**|People who have similar thoughts and abilities recommend the same actions - often sustaining the status quo|
|**Finger-pointing**|When balls are dropped because new angles haven't been considered, organizations that lack diversity point fingers inward rather than look for fresh perspectives from the outside|
|**Why Didn't I Think of That?**|A classic indignant question asked when a diverse perspective *outside* the team breeds a better, more creative idea|
|**Who Could Have Known?**|A lack of diversity always increases the odds that those in charge will fail to identify possible risks because of their limited perspective|
|**Outpaced by Innovation**|Diversity brings a freshness of ideas - organizations that lack diversity are slower to innovate|
|**Groupthink**|When teams are pressured to accept the shared consensus, they're less likely to share new (or potentially controversial) ideas|

War Story: failure in the Bay of Pigs
- secret plan developed by the CIA, not the Pentagon, where expertise in such operations traditionally lay
- when the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) were asked to give their opinion on the plan, they didn't do a good job pointing out the pitfalls

War Story: Cuban missile crisis
- Kennedy also pulled in Executive Committee of the National Security Council (ExComm)
- JCS wanted to address the problem with aggressive military postures
- ExComm had a different take and suggested using blockades

Theranos - although Elizabeth Holmes seemed to be the paragon of diversity.. her board members were not
    - the board members had no medical or biotech expertise

> **The Bottom Line**: Diversity isn't a nice-to-do, it's a need-to-do.  Different perspectives and skills increase our effectiveness.  Achieving diversity requires deliberate action.

## Chapter 8 - Bias - Filters that Distort

> Leaders who are perceived as being successful aren't always given a crown, but often do get a hall pass

### Symptoms of Common Types of Biases
|Symption|Description|
|---|---|
|**Common Information Sampling Bias**|The bias to spend more energy and time on information everyone already knows rather than information that is new and could likely be helpful (communication)|
|**Confirmation Bias**|The bias to lean on an existing belief and continually search for information to support it. (narrative)|
|**Halo effect**|The bias to see someone favorably, regardless of actions. (leadership)|
|**Status Quo Bias**|The bias to believe the current state of affairs is the preferable option (action)|
|**Hindsight Bias**|The bias to believe, after an event has occurred, that they would have predicted what the outcome of the event would have been (timing)|
|**Plan-Continuation Bias**|The bias to not alter the course of action when situations change (adaptability)|
|**Ingroup Bias**|The bias to think those within a group are superior than those outside of it (diversity)|

> When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail
In the book, the military always preferred aggressive postures in conflicts.  There are however alternatives.

**Red-teaming**: a process that uses an outside team to search for weakness in a plan or an organization

> **The Bottom Line**: Biases are the lens through which we see the world. Often rooted in our experiences and self-interests, they are largely unavoidable - but can dangerously distort our perspectives.

---

## Chapter 9 - Action - The Coefficient of Friction

> there is no action unless inertia is overcome
> coefficient of friction: how much action is required to either move an object that is at rest or continue moving an object already in motion 

War story: the US was aware of Bin Laden even back in the 90s
- We had the UAV capability even back in the 90s, but it wasn't actually used
- there were probably many reasons why, but in the end, Bin Laden's momentum continued to grow uninterrupted

### Symptoms of Common Types of Biases
|Symption|Description|
|---|---|
|**Slow Reaction Time**|Organizations that are biased for inaction tend to be slower to react and sluggish to adapt|
|**Missed Chances**|Teams plagued by inertia fail to take advantage of opportunities, too set in their ways to change|
|**Contradictory Efforts**|Teams experience whiplash when actions conflict and distract from a goal|
|**Playing Catch-up with Competitors**|Teams that don't act quickly and effectively are rapidly surpassed by more aggressive and decisive organizations|
|**Analysis Paralysis**|We fail to act at all when we are laser-focused on identifying options and paralyzed by the number of choices available to us|
|**Reactive Posture**|We tend to react (sometimes emotionally) when we are not properly positioned for action|

War story: the "Night raids" 
- Afghans found the night raids abhorrent
- entering the house of someone uninvited is an extreme taboo
- > the process we employed to improve our security directly challenged Afghan concepts of security

> **The Bottom Line**: Ultimately, what we do (or don't do) determines the outcome.

---

## Chapter 10 - Timing - Slow Buses and Fast Cars

> Actions taken to mitigate risk must account for appropriate timing.

Examples: 
- Taiwan had a rapid response to COVID, while the US didn't.   The delay in US action (even by just a few weeks), caused a major impact
- Response to Hurricane Katrina was a failure in timing on many levels.  
    - Pre-storm decision making lagged badly and Lousiana didn't declare a state of emergency on time.  
    - Bussing people from their homes to the SuperDome and then from there to a safer location
    - Bus drivers had already evacuated the area leaving buses filled with gas but parked
    - Coordination between FEMA and DOT was poor.  FEMA needed to make a decision earlier to allow DOT to perform transportation.
    - Bus drivers got lost when trying to find the Superdome

### Symptoms of Timing Challenges
|Symption|Description|
|---|---|
|**Hurry Up and Wait**|Poorly timed decisions can often cause some parts of the plan to be rushed, and others to be painfully delayed|
|**Undercooked Cake**|Taking a cake out of the oven too early means a soggy, unappetizing mess. Cutting corners and speeding up processes can compromise the end result.|
|**Jumping the Gun**|Sprinters who take off before the starting gun are disqualified from the race. Acting too early (though often in eagerness) can prevent the successful execution of a plan.|
|**Too Little, too Late**|We often don't know how long processes take until we're knee-deep in them.  Thinking ahead can save you time overall.|
|**Creating More Work**|Those who make decisions too quickly will often have to make new decisions once the conditions inevitably change|

### Three Pit Stops
- The story of 1998 Hungarian Grand Prix, Michael Schumacher racing in the Ferrari against two McLarens (three-pit-stop strategy).

> Slow is Smooth, Smooth is Fast

## Chapter 11 - Adaptability - Willing and Able

### The Fosbury Flop
- change in high-jump technique
- hard landing grounds had changed gritty sandpits and heaps of sawdust into cushiony foam pits.  It was safer to try bold maneuvers
- Dick Fosbury was *willing* to to push the boundaries

### Symptoms of Adaptability Struggles
|Symptom|Description|
|---|---|
|**Two Beats Behind**|Teams that do not adapt lag their more agile competitors - with predictable results|
|**Frozen by Fear of Failure**|Frightened by the specter of failure (or accepting responsibility for an adaptation that didn't work), leaders and their organizations remain unchanged as failure overwhelms them|
|**Supercharging a Losing Engine**|Teams that rely on a relentless pursuit of maximizing an approach they have long used - unwilling to adapt to changing conditions and competition - watch the ship of progress sail by.  Soon after Fosbury's win, competitors who didn't do the Fosbury Flop were weeded out of the competition|
|**Unable to Innovate**|Organizations so set in their ways fail to look up, see what the new world demands, and innovate accordingly|
|**"Why Didn't I Think of That?"**|Teams that don't have an adaptive mentality are often stumped as to why they hadn't thought of cutting-edge solutions to new issues and problems.|

### The iPhone Killer
- Nokia initially being the undisputed choice for mobile devices very quickly lost ground
- Nokia's hubris and inaction caused it to rest on its laurels.  Apple and Android crept into the market
- The new abilities of these new smartphones changed consumer preferences
- Consumers used to buy Nokia because of their indestructibles phones, but consumers now purchased based on what the phone could do
- Nokia had to give up its mobile device business and was thought to have lost everything
- They shifted their focus to the firm's "corporate orphan", Nokia Siemens Network (NSN)
- The company had to do a major shift but ultimately was successful in its adaptation
