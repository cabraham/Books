Choice architecture - the system for organizing the context in which people make decisions

Libertarian paternalism - essentially to be free to choose but have a recommended and guidance "pit of success".  This philosophy respects the freedom of individuals but seeks to influence their decision making for their best possible outcome.  

Nudge - any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives

Homo-economicus - the economic man - the notion that each of us thinks and chooses unfailingly well, and thus fits within the usual depiction of human beings that is offered by economists

There is a false assumption that almost all people, almost all the time, make choices that are in their best interest or at the very least are better than choices that would be made by someone else
- this is false because it depends on their level of experience, good information, and prompt feedback
- people tend to fare worse in contexts they are inexperienced and poorly informed

There are 2 misconceptions
1. it is possible to avoid influencing people's choices.  No matter the context, there will always be an influence, whether intentional or not.  Most often, there is a "design" that is influencing the choice architecture
2. paternalism always involves coercion



### Rules of Thumb
Rules of thumb (a.k.a. heuristics) may be useful in some capacities, however they can also lead to systematic biases.  There are 3 common types of rules of thumb

1. Anchoring - the process of starting with a figure you know, and adjusting in the direction you think is appropriate
2. Availability - a heuristic where you are guessing the likelihood of an event based on available knowledge
Examples
- more gun related deaths are caused by suicide, but most will guess homicide based on what is reported in the news
- if you've experienced an earthquake or natural disaster before, you will *feel* that it is more likely to occur
3. Representativeness



### Two Systems of thinking

System 1 - automatic, quick, intuitive, heuristic based

System 2 - requires effort, usually complex, analytical


System 1 generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations
